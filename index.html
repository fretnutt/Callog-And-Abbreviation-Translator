You should contact your dealer or the tire manufacturer for more information.\n- Service: Any authorized Chevrolet or tire dealer can assist with tire service.\nWhat is NOT Covered (Tires):\n- Normal Wear and Wear-out: Normal tire wear or wear-out is not considered a defect and is therefore not covered.\n- Road Hazard Damage: Damage such as punctures, cuts, snags, and breaks resulting from pothole impacts, curb impacts, or other objects is not covered.\n- Misuse/Improper Operation: Damage from improper inflation, overloading, spinning (e.g., stuck in mud or snow), tire chains, racing, improper mounting/dismounting, misuse, negligence, alteration, or improper repair is not covered.\n- TPMS Sensors: TPMS sensor damage caused by using non-GM approved tire sealant or non-GM valve caps is not covered by the vehicle warranty.\n- Tire Alignment: Tire wear due to misalignment beyond the warranty period is not covered.\n- GM recommends that tires, including the spare, be replaced after six years, regardless of tread wear, due to rubber aging.\n- You are responsible for maintaining correct tire pressure, even if the TPMS low tire pressure telltale has not illuminated."},{"abbr":"req","title":"Required Elements of a Business Case Checklist","text":"This checklist outlines the minimum required elements for a business case justification.
