If a pressure washer is used, specific criteria must be followed (e.g., pressure below 14,000 kPa (2,000 PSI), water temperature below 80°C (180°F), nozzle at least 30 cm (1 ft) away).\n- Original Equipment Alterations: Any damage or failure from modifications, alterations, or tampering to the vehicle's original equipment, including non-GM parts, calibrations, or software modifications, can void warranty coverage for affected components.\n- Collision Damage: Damage resulting from collision, fire, theft, freezing, vandalism, riot, explosion, or objects striking the vehicle is not covered. Poorly performed collision repairs can diminish resale value and compromise safety performance. Aftermarket collision parts are also not covered by the GM New Vehicle Limited Warranty, and related failures are excluded." },
                    { abbr: "twc", title: "Tire Warranty", text: "Tires supplied with your Chevrolet vehicle are covered under the Bumper-to-Bumper coverage against defects in material or workmanship.\nKey Coverage Details:\n- Initial Period: For vehicles within the Bumper-to-Bumper coverage (typically 3 years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first), defective tires will be replaced on a prorated adjustment basis for the tire cost. Chevrolet covers 100% of the cost to mount and balance tires replaced under warranty during this full Bumper-to-Bumper period.\n- Prorated Schedule (Tire Cost):\n  - 0-12,000 miles: 100% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 12,001-15,000 miles: 60% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 15,001-20,000 miles: 50% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 20,001-25,000 miles: 40% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 25,001-30,000 miles: 30% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 30,001-36,000 miles: 20% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 36,000+ miles: 0% covered by Chevrolet\n- After Bumper-to-Bumper: After the Bumper-to-Bumper coverage expires, you may still have prorated warranty coverage on your original equipment tires directly from the tire manufacturer. You should contact your dealer or the tire manufacturer for more information.\n- Service: Any authorized Chevrolet or tire dealer can assist with tire service.\nWhat is NOT Covered (Tires):\n- Normal Wear and Wear-out: Normal tire wear or wear-out is not considered a defect and is therefore not covered. Tire wear is influenced by factors like road conditions, driving styles, vehicle weight, and tire construction. Uniform tire wear is considered a normal condition.\n- Road Hazard Damage: Damage such as punctures, cuts, snags, and breaks resulting from pothole impacts, curb impacts, or other objects is not covered.\n- Misuse/Improper Operation: Damage from improper inflation, overloading, spinning (e.g., stuck in mud or snow), tire chains, racing, improper mounting/dismounting, misuse, negligence, alteration, improper repair, accident, collision, fire, vandalism, or misapplication is not covered.\n- Automatic Car Washes/Cleaning Agents: Damage to wheels or tire sidewalls caused by automatic car washes or cleaning agents is not covered. Specifically, driving through automatic car washes that use silicon carbide tire/wheel cleaning brushes can cause damage not covered by warranty.\n- TPMS Sensors: TPMS sensor damage caused by using non-GM approved tire sealant or non-GM valve caps is not covered by the vehicle warranty.\n- Tire Alignment: Tire wear due to misalignment beyond the warranty period is not covered. Factory alignment and balance are for longest life and best performance, and adjustments are not necessary regularly.\nImportant Tire-Related Information:\n- GM recommends using TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline to keep the engine clean and maintain optimal performance.\n- GM strongly recommends buying replacement tires with the same TPC Spec rating as the original equipment tires, as this system considers many specifications for vehicle performance (e.g., braking, handling, traction control, TPMS). If a TPC Spec tire is unavailable, replacements should be the same size, load range, speed rating, and construction (radial).\n- All-season tires provide adequate performance for most winter driving conditions but may not offer the same traction as winter tires on snow or ice. Winter tires are designed for increased traction on snow/ice but may have decreased dry road traction, increased road noise, and shorter tread life.\n- Tires should be rotated every 12,000 km (7,500 mi). The first rotation is most important.\n- GM recommends that tires, including the spare, be replaced after six years, regardless of tread wear, due to rubber aging.\n- You are responsible for maintaining correct tire pressure, even if the TPMS low tire pressure telltale has not illuminated." },

If not, direct them to do so first.\n\nRun Policy Evaluation Tool (PET):\n- Use the actual repair estimate, not $1.\n- If the PET result is \"NOT eligible,\" cost assistance should be denied.\n- If the PET result is \"MAY BE ELIGIBLE,\" inform the customer their request will be reviewed with the dealer, but do not promise assistance or disclose the amount.\n\nPartner with the Dealer: Reach out to the dealer to see if they plan to offer assistance.
