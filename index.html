I've thoroughly reviewed your situation regarding your [Vehicle Model] and the concerns you've raised, and I want to start by saying I understand your frustration. It's definitely not the experience we want you to have with your GM vehicle.\nAfter a comprehensive review of all the details, including the service history for your vehicle and the terms of the manufacturer's limited warranty, we've determined that we are unable to approve your request for a vehicle buyback or to cover the current repair costs.\nThe primary reason for this decision is that our assessment indicates that the reported issue with your vehicle appears to be a result of the vehicle being operated beyond its designed capacities. For example, the owner's manual for the Chevrolet Blazer states that if a trailer is too heavy or the trailer brakes are inadequate for the load, the vehicle may be damaged, and the repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Similarly, the Silverado manual warns that operating the vehicle for extended periods without the front fascia lower air dam, if equipped, can cause improper airflow to the engine, which would not be covered by the warranty. Such conditions are considered outside the scope of the manufacturer's limited warranty, which outlines the specific coverages and the contractual obligations. This contractual basis means GM is not obligated to cover repair costs once the vehicle is outside those agreed-upon limits.\nI know this isn't the outcome you were hoping for. This decision was made after careful consideration of your vehicle's service history and the explicit terms of the manufacturer's limited warranty contract. We have documented your concerns and this decision.\nWhile we regret that we cannot provide a more favorable response in this instance, please be aware of available options for dispute resolution:\n\nIn the United States, you may be eligible to utilize the BBB AUTO LINE Program. This is an out-of-court program administered by BBB National Programs, Inc., designed to settle automotive disputes regarding vehicle repairs or the interpretation of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. This program is free of charge, and your case will generally be heard within 40 days. If you do not agree with the decision, you may reject it and pursue other available avenues for relief. For California residents specifically, the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act provides certain rights if GM or its authorized repair facilities have been unable to repair a new motor vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts. You would need to provide written notice to GM for this process.\nFor Canadian owners, General Motors of Canada Company participates in a no-charge Mediation/Arbitration Program. This program offers an impartial third-party arbiter to review the facts of owner disputes involving factory-related vehicle service claims, with the entire process typically completed in about 70 days.\nAlthough this specific request cannot be approved for warranty coverage, we recommend having the necessary repairs completed at your preferred GM dealership, as they are specially trained and equipped to diagnose and assist with repairs. While any repairs will be at your cost, they can ensure the work is done correctly. Thank you for your understanding.\"" },
                    { abbr: "pwc", title: "Paint Warranty", text: "Chevrolet's paint warranty covers defects related to materials or workmanship.\nKey Coverage Details:\n- Surface Corrosion: Body sheet metal panels are covered against rust for 3 years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first.\n- Rust-Through Corrosion: Body sheet metal panels that develop an actual hole due to rust-through are covered for 6 years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first.\n- Chemical Paint Spotting: Damage from airborne pollutants causing blotchy, ring-shaped discolorations or irregular dark spots is covered for 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first, even though it's not a factory paint defect.\n- Minor Chips/Scratches: Quickly repair minor chips and scratches with touch-up materials from your dealer to avoid corrosion.\n- Collision Damage: Original manufacturer replacement parts will provide corrosion protection and maintain the vehicle warranty after sheet metal repair or replacement.\nWhat is NOT Covered (Paint):\n- Cosmetic/Surface Corrosion: Rust resulting from stone chips, dents, or scratches in the paint, or failure to repair such damage, is not included.\n- Environmental Damage: Damage caused by airborne fallout, rail dust, salt (from sea air or road conditions), chemicals, tree sap, insects, stones, hail, earthquakes, water/floods, windstorms, or lightning, and other environmental conditions is not covered.\n- After-manufacture Treatments: Damage caused by the application of after-manufacture rustproofing products or other chemical sealants is not covered, as these may reduce the vehicle's built-in corrosion resistance.\n- Improper Cleaning Agents/Methods:\n  - Damage from using petroleum-based, acidic, or abrasive cleaning agents on paint, metal, or plastic parts is not covered.\n  - Machine compounding or aggressive polishing on basecoat/clearcoat paint finish may damage it and is cautioned against.\n  - Failure to clean and protect bright metal moldings can result in hazy white finish or pitting, which is not covered.\n  - Damage to chrome wheels and trim if the vehicle is not washed after exposure to magnesium chloride or calcium chloride (used for dust/ice control on roads).\n  - Using petroleum-based tire dressing products on painted surfaces.\n  - Power washing components under the hood or the vehicle's interior can cause damage that is not covered by the warranty. If a pressure washer is used, specific criteria must be followed (e.g., pressure below 14,000 kPa (2,000 PSI), water temperature below 80°C (180°F), nozzle at least 30 cm (1 ft) away).\n- Original Equipment Alterations: Any damage or failure from modifications, alterations, or tampering to the vehicle's original equipment, including non-GM parts, calibrations, or software modifications, can void warranty coverage for affected components.\n- Collision Damage: Damage resulting from collision, fire, theft, freezing, vandalism, riot, explosion, or objects striking the vehicle is not covered. Poorly performed collision repairs can diminish resale value and compromise safety performance. Aftermarket collision parts are also not covered by the GM New Vehicle Limited Warranty, and related failures are excluded." },
                    { abbr: "twc", title: "Tire Warranty", text: "Tires supplied with your Chevrolet vehicle are covered under the Bumper-to-Bumper coverage against defects in material or workmanship.\nKey Coverage Details:\n- Initial Period: For vehicles within the Bumper-to-Bumper coverage (typically 3 years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first), defective tires will be replaced on a prorated adjustment basis for the tire cost. Chevrolet covers 100% of the cost to mount and balance tires replaced under warranty during this full Bumper-to-Bumper period.\n- Prorated Schedule (Tire Cost):\n  - 0-12,000 miles: 100% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 12,001-15,000 miles: 60% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 15,001-20,000 miles: 50% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 20,001-25,000 miles: 40% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 25,001-30,000 miles: 30% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 30,001-36,000 miles: 20% covered by Chevrolet\n  - 36,000+ miles: 0% covered by Chevrolet\n- After Bumper-to-Bumper: After the Bumper-to-Bumper coverage expires, you may still have prorated warranty coverage on your original equipment tires directly from the tire manufacturer. You should contact your dealer or the tire manufacturer for more information.\n- Service: Any authorized Chevrolet or tire dealer can assist with tire service.\nWhat is NOT Covered (Tires):\n- Normal Wear and Wear-out: Normal tire wear or wear-out is not considered a defect and is therefore not covered. Tire wear is influenced by factors like road conditions, driving styles, vehicle weight, and tire construction. Uniform tire wear is considered a normal condition.\n- Road Hazard Damage: Damage such as punctures, cuts, snags, and breaks resulting from pothole impacts, curb impacts, or other objects is not covered.\n- Misuse/Improper Operation: Damage from improper inflation, overloading, spinning (e.g., stuck in mud or snow), tire chains, racing, improper mounting/dismounting, misuse, negligence, alteration, improper repair, accident, collision, fire, vandalism, or misapplication is not covered.\n- Automatic Car Washes/Cleaning Agents: Damage to wheels or tire sidewalls caused by automatic car washes or cleaning agents is not covered. Specifically, driving through automatic car washes that use silicon carbide tire/wheel cleaning brushes can cause damage not covered by warranty.\n- TPMS Sensors: TPMS sensor damage caused by using non-GM approved tire sealant or non-GM valve caps is not covered by the vehicle warranty.\n- Tire Alignment: Tire wear due to misalignment beyond the warranty period is not covered. Factory alignment and balance are for longest life and best performance, and adjustments are not necessary regularly.\nImportant Tire-Related Information:\n- GM recommends using TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline to keep the engine clean and maintain optimal performance.\n- GM strongly recommends buying replacement tires with the same TPC Spec rating as the original equipment tires, as this system considers many specifications for vehicle performance (e.g., braking, handling, traction control, TPMS). If a TPC Spec tire is unavailable, replacements should be the same size, load range, speed rating, and construction (radial).\n- All-season tires provide adequate performance for most winter driving conditions but may not offer the same traction as winter tires on snow or ice. Winter tires are designed for increased traction on snow/ice but may have decreased dry road traction, increased road noise, and shorter tread life.\n- Tires should be rotated every 12,000 km (7,500 mi). The first rotation is most important.\n- GM recommends that tires, including the spare, be replaced after six years, regardless of tread wear, due to rubber aging.\n- You are responsible for maintaining correct tire pressure, even if the TPMS low tire pressure telltale has not illuminated." },

If not, direct them to do so first.\n\nRun Policy Evaluation Tool (PET):\n- Use the actual repair estimate, not $1.\n- If the PET result is \"NOT eligible,\" cost assistance should be denied.\n- If the PET result is \"MAY BE ELIGIBLE,\" inform the customer their request will be reviewed with the dealer, but do not promise assistance or disclose the amount.\n\nPartner with the Dealer: Reach out to the dealer to see if they plan to offer assistance.
