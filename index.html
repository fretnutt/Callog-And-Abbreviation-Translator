I've thoroughly reviewed your situation regarding your [Vehicle Model] and the concerns you've raised, and I want to start by saying I understand your frustration. It's definitely not the experience we want you to have with your GM vehicle.\nAfter a comprehensive review of all the details, including the service history for your vehicle and the terms of the manufacturer's limited warranty, we've determined that we are unable to approve your request for a vehicle buyback or to cover the current repair costs.\nThe primary reason for this decision is that our assessment indicates that the reported issue with your vehicle appears to be a result of the vehicle being operated beyond its designed capacities. For example, the owner's manual for the Chevrolet Blazer states that if a trailer is too heavy or the trailer brakes are inadequate for the load, the vehicle may be damaged, and the repairs would not be covered by the vehicle warranty. Similarly, the Silverado manual warns that operating the vehicle for extended periods without the front fascia lower air dam, if equipped, can cause improper airflow to the engine, which would not be covered by the warranty. Such conditions are considered outside the scope of the manufacturer's limited warranty, which outlines the specific coverages and the contractual obligations. This contractual basis means GM is not obligated to cover repair costs once the vehicle is outside those agreed-upon limits.\nI know this isn't the outcome you were hoping for. This decision was made after careful consideration of your vehicle's service history and the explicit terms of the manufacturer's limited warranty contract. We have documented your concerns and this decision.\nWhile we regret that we cannot provide a more favorable response in this instance, please be aware of available options for dispute resolution:\n\nIn the United States, you may be eligible to utilize the BBB AUTO LINE Program. This is an out-of-court program administered by BBB National Programs, Inc., designed to settle automotive disputes regarding vehicle repairs or the interpretation of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. This program is free of charge, and your case will generally be heard within 40 days. If you do not agree with the decision, you may reject it and pursue other available avenues for relief. For California residents specifically, the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act provides certain rights if GM or its authorized repair facilities have been unable to repair a new motor vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts. You would need to provide written notice to GM for this process.\nFor Canadian owners, General Motors of Canada Company participates in a no-charge Mediation/Arbitration Program. This program offers an impartial third-party arbiter to review the facts of owner disputes involving factory-related vehicle service claims, with the entire process typically completed in about 70 days.\nAlthough this specific request cannot be approved for warranty coverage, we recommend having the necessary repairs completed at your preferred GM dealership, as they are specially trained and equipped to diagnose and assist with repairs. While any repairs will be at your cost, they can ensure the work is done correctly. Thank you for your understanding.\"" },
